# Allow users in the 'sudo' group to restart the VPN service or kill its process
# without a password. If the user authenticates via AD, and the VPN dies, then
# sudo requests take a *VERY* long time to # prompt for the password and then
# execute. This is a catch-22, because the only way to remedy the situation is
# to restart the VPN service (severing the dead connection).
